# Feature and sentiment extraction for Amazon products

This project (part of my MSc in AI) takes in product reviews mined from Amazon which have been prelabelled with both sentiment and features, cleans and preprocesses it, before returning the top features and their sentiment derived from either a rule-based model or a Naive Bayes sentiment classifier. 
The Jupyter Notebook illustrates the process in detail, and includes all code required to run the system on the supplied data.
